🎯 Notes

All file operations are local; nothing is sent over the internet.

Large folders may take longer depending on the number of files.

Logs of moved files are stored in server/log.json for undo functionality.

Dark Mode and progress bar improve UX but can be customized.

Keep your folder paths correct to avoid errors.
